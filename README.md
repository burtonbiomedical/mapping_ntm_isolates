# Geoencoding Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacterium isolates in Bronchiectasis patients

In this Jupyter Notebook project I used the Python programming langauge, Google Maps API, and Bokeh JS to create an interactive desplace of Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacterium isolates.

Due to the nature of the research I cannot share the raw data files or outcomes of this analysis, but the source code is documented in the notebook contained in this repo. Project dependencies are: Pandas, Numpy, Bokeh JS, gmplot
